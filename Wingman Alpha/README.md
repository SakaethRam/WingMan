### Arkin X: Arkin X proudly presents Wingman Alpha, a cutting-edge virtual assistant designed to redefine task automation and elevate user experiences.  

### Wingman Alpha:  

Design and implement a voice-controlled virtual assistant capable of executing tasks such as playing music via Spotify, retrieving system utilization details, opening web pages, and responding to user queries using speech recognition. The assistant should support a wake word to initiate interactions and allow users to pause or resume its operations through voice commands.

#### **Introduction**:
Virtual assistants are increasingly integrated into daily tasks, providing hands-free automation for various functions. This Python-based assistant utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis to execute commands like playing music, opening web pages, and monitoring system performance. It ensures an interactive and seamless experience by leveraging threading for concurrent operations and integrating Spotify for media playback.

#### **Pre-Requisites**
1. **Install Python**  
   Ensure that Python is installed on your system to support the execution of the assistant's script.  

2. **Install Required Packages**  
   Install the necessary Python packages such as `psutil`, `pyttsx3`, and `webbrowser` to enable Zenith's functionality.  

3. **Create a Directory**  
   Set up a dedicated directory on your C drive under the path `C:\Users` to organize and manage Zenith's files.  

#### Steps to Set Up Zenith:  
1. **Create a Python Script**  
   Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) and create a file with a `.py` extension, which will contain the assistant's code.  

2. **Copy the Code**  
   Copy the provided code and paste it into the newly created `.py` file. Save the changes.  

3. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   Open the Command Prompt, and use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the directory where the `.py` file is saved.  

4. **Run the Script**  
   Once in the correct directory, execute the script by typing the command: `python <filename>.py` (replace `<filename>` with the actual name of your file).  

5. **Launch Wingman Aplha**  
   Upon successful execution of the script, Zenith will begin operating, ready to assist you in automating tasks efficiently.
